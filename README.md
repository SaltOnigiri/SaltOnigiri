Aka Camryn Way!

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
Future programmer and lifelong humanitarian. I'm a third-year student at Meredith with dreams of working my way up as an advanced programmer and data analyst. For as long as I can remember, I've had a deep love for all things computer inside and out. I built my first computer from scratch when I was twelve years old. I plan to graduate with a major in Computer Science. My background has required me to be a strong manager of my time to balance school and work, and I look forward to meeting and working with you!
